## 🩺 Scalable Machine Learning for Diabetes Prediction on AWS with PyCaret and FastAPI

In this project, we’ll build a **scalable machine learning model** to predict **diabetes** using the **PyCaret** library. We’ll deploy the model on **AWS S3** and create a **FastAPI** web application to allow users to interact with the model. Let’s combine machine learning with cloud deployment for a scalable solution! 🚀🌐

## Project Overview

This project involves creating a machine learning model to predict **diabetes** using **PyCaret**, a low-code library for automating machine learning tasks. Once we’ve created and fine-tuned the model, we’ll deploy it to **AWS S3** for scalable storage and access. 

We’ll then build a **FastAPI** web application that enables users to interact with the deployed model by submitting input data to get predictions. This project showcases the full process of building, deploying, and serving a machine learning model on the cloud, making it accessible via an API.

### Key Features:

- 🔍 **Model Comparison**: Use **PyCaret** to compare multiple machine learning models and select the best-performing one.
- 🛠️ **Model Tuning**: Fine-tune, plot, and save the best model for diabetes prediction.
- ☁️ **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy the finalized model on **AWS S3** for scalable access.
- 🌐 **FastAPI Integration**: Build a **FastAPI** web app to interact with the deployed model and make predictions in real time.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for machine learning and web app development.
- **PyCaret**: For creating, tuning, and managing machine learning models.
- **AWS S3**: For storing and deploying the machine learning model in the cloud.
- **FastAPI**: For building a fast, interactive web application to serve the model.

## 🤖 Skills Applied

- Machine Learning with PyCaret
- Cloud Deployment with AWS
- Data Visualization and Model Tuning
- FastAPI Web Application Development

## Example Tasks You Can Do

- **Train and Tune Models**: Use PyCaret to train and compare multiple models for diabetes prediction.
- **Deploy to AWS**: Store the model in AWS S3 for scalable access from other applications.
- **Create FastAPI App**: Build a FastAPI app to interact with the model and provide real-time predictions based on user input.
